  Doctor is a utility which aims to provide insights into the health of your project's documentation.
  In addition to be a useful development time tool, Doctor can also be useful during CI/CD and can block
  merges and releases if the documentation coverage is not up to spec.

  Doctor comes with sane defaults out of the box, but if you wish to customize its settings, feel free to
  create your own .doctor.exs file.
